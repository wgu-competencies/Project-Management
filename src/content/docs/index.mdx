# Project Management Skills Registry

An authoritative, versioned skill registry for Project Management, designed as the objectives layer in an Instruction as Code ecosystem.

It defines a canonical set of **Project Management competencies** as structured, versioned **Rich Skill Descriptors (RSDs)**.

- 🔗 **Linked Data** - Skills use RSD format with proper JSON-LD context

## Philosophy

> Collections are built, not written.  
> Git is the governance layer.

This repository treats skills as **composable, machine-readable artifacts** governed through Git, enabling AI-driven curriculum design and reproducible instructional systems.
