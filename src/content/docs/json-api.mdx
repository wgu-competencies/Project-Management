## Content Negotiation

The API serves JSON by default. For human-readable pages, browse `/browse/skills/{uuid}`.

## Caching

Skills are immutable once published. The collection is rebuilt on every deployment.

**Recommended caching:**
- Individual skills: Cache indefinitely (immutable)
- Collection: Cache with short TTL or use ETags

## Rate Limits

GitHub Pages has no formal rate limits, but please be respectful:
- Cache responses when possible
- Use the collection endpoint for bulk access instead of individual requests
- Don't scrape - the entire repository is available via Git

## CORS

All endpoints support CORS and can be accessed from any origin.

## Versioning

Skills are versioned through Git tags. To access a specific version:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wgu-competencies/Project-Management
git checkout v1.0.0
```

## Source Repository

The authoritative source is the Git repository:
```
https://github.com/wgu-competencies/Project-Management
```

Skills are defined in `/skills/{uuid}.json` files.
